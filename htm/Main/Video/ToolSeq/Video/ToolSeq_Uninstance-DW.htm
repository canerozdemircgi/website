Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Uninstance is a great tool to relocate your creations to the next generation.
Select your transforms and left-click on the Transforms label to write them into the Transforms panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
Uninstance Hierarchy button, analyzes your kinda complex groups which may have multiple duplicated or instanced shapes, transforms, groups etc at first.
Afterwards uninstance all of them one by one while making sure to keep everything in place.
Unfortunately connections of materials or other minor stuff like that may be broken.
These broken connections do not come back even after undoing, just keep in mind.
By the way if you wanna keep your original groups, check Keep Old checkbox.
If you use the standard Instance to Object feature of Maya, it will fail.
The next section gives you the opportunity of adding or replacing core shapes seamlessly in a complex hierarchy.
To do this, you will need a source shape and a target shape of course.
Select your source transform and click on the Source Shape label to write into its own LineBox.
Select your target transform and click on the Target Shape label to write into its own LineBox.
Add Instanced Shape button will add instances of the source shape into all parents of the target shape.
Replace Instanced Shape button will replace all target shapes with instances of the source shape.
You have to match their ungrouped transformations for the correct result.
There is another utility called ToolSeq Freeze which you can benefit for this one.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
