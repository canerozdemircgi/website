Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq ItemHud extends functionality of the Poly Count module of the Heads Up Display by adding a few more informations on it.
There are three rows over here.
The first column of the first row displays count of all shapes in your scene.
The second column of the first row displays count of selected shapes in your scene.
The first column of the second row displays count of all transforms in your scene.
The second column of the second row displays count of selected transforms in your scene.
The third row displays count of all selections in your scene regardless of selection type.
So let us try a few examples real quick.
Click on the ItemHud shelf button to toggle ToolSeq ItemHud.
