Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Select is a tidy tool to control your selections.
So lets start with these buttons pretty quickly.
Select Loop or Ring Standard button uses this integer parameter over here then converts your selections to edges.
Then loops or rings your edge selections with the specified interval.
Left-click for loops, right-click for rings.
This button is also compatible with multiple selections.
Select Loop or Ring Pattern button loops or rings edge selections by using relation between current selected edge and previous selected edge.
That means we must select two edges.
Same rule applies here, left-click for loops, right-click for rings.
Select Soft, Select Hard and Select Border buttons of the next section, filters your selected items to edges by being soft, hard or border.
Select Loops Lower Than Angle button uses this float parameter over here to select loops if only angles of all belonging edges are lower than the specified angle.
It may be useful to detect least effecting edges which probably are safely deletable.
The final section is about selection sets.
Union, Subtract and Intersect buttons are shorcuts of Maya's internal commands about selection sets.
Two selection sets are processed by an operation as the name of buttons point out, Union, Subtract and Intersect.
The first selection set is based on your current selections and the second selection set is the previously saved set.
So that means results will be saved after the operation.
You can change the name of selection set over here which will be saved.
There are two more buttons for displaying saved selection set or clearing saved selection set.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
