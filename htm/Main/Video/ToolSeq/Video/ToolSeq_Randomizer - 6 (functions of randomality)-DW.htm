Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
Let us take a look at the Function tab over here.
Big combobox on the middle left includes functions defined in random library within the python language.
There are two exceptions which do not belong to python library directly, solo and custom.
That means you can search these functions over internet and get all kind of informations about them except solo and custom.
We have already mentioned about uniform and solo.
So Uniform returns a value between minimum and maximum limits and solo returns its single parameter value.
To get a general idea about value distributions of rest, you can utilize python scripts in the 'other' folder of ToolSeq.
Just locate your ToolSeq installation over here then open up 'other' directory then dive into 'ToolSeq Randomizer' directory.
Alright foremost, you will need a python interpreter installed in your operating system to execute python scripts.
Then run all commands in the lib file to install python library requirements.
After that open up any file you wish within a text editor and examine parameters at the almost beginning of them.
Change parameters as you wonder and double click to execute the script file.
Afterwards you will see a distribution graph which will give probabilities of values.
Let's check gauss distribution, with mu one hundred and sigma fifty, values close to one hundred have higher probabilities.
And the further we get from each side, probability decreases.
Let's look a few of them pretty quickly.
Let's change parameters of gauss for instance and take look at the graph again.
With mu ten and sigma one, values close to ten have higher probabilities.
Minimum limit seems almost like six and maximum limit seems almost like fourteen.
As soon as you decided your parameters, write into the Randoms panel by clicking on the Insert button after selecting your function in its combobox.
You can also right click on the Randoms label to do exactly same.
Left-clicking on the Randoms label will write and right-clicking on the Randoms label will append combobox value into Randoms panel.
Middle clicking clears panel as you remember.
Then change initial parameters with your decided ones.
Alright so let's see a few of them in action with movY component mode operation.
There is one more called custom if you wanna go even deeper and write your random function.
Locate your installation again and find the file named ToolSeq Randoms.py, open it with a text editor.
You will see all functions in the combobox here including custom, change custom function with your own implementation according to your demands.
Variables set in pre-commands can be captured here without doing anything extra.
You will get more detailed informations about pre-commands in one of the future videos.
When you make modifications in this file, you have to click the Reload button to reflect your changes.
Otherwise you have to restart Maya to reflect changes.
Let's see this one pretty quickly.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
