Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
We will clarify rest of function options over here.
To demonstrate these options a little bit better, let's begin with sorting.
As you may guess, this combobox will sort your random values by ascending or descending order.
So in each iteration, you will get a bigger or a smaller value than previous.
Alright so let's try it out.
Function limit combobox over here can be used to specify minimum and maximum limits of functions.
It is quite easy to control boundaries of Uniform, Triangular and Solo functions.
But for others you may struggle more, if you need exact minimum and maximum limits for your procedure.
So you can use any of Clamp or Return then assign your minimum and maximum values to control overflow.
Clamp will simply assign minimum if the value is below minimum and assign maximum if the value is above maximum.
Return will equally redistribute these values by using float mod interpolation so no clutter happens at the lowest and highest levels.
Let's see this one in action.
Let's talk about interval. This one divides results into intervals and round your values to the closest split.
You have to append a big straight vertical bar then append the divisor at the end of each line.
Let's try what I am talking about.
If you use percentage and interval at the same time, first bar goes to percentage, second bar goes to interval.
Let's see this one.
If you don't wanna apply interval to any of multiple functions, you can bypass interval by typing zero value as divisor.
Let's talk about exclude. This one allows you to eliminate spesified values from results.
You have to append a big straight vertical bar then append one exclusion or multiple exclusions with space separator at the end of each line.
If you use percentage and exclude at the same time, first bar goes to percentage, second bar goes to exclude.
If you use percentage and interval and exclude at the same time, first bar goes to percentage, second bar goes to interval, third bar goes to exclude.
Let's try what I am talking about.
If you don't wanna apply exclude to any of multiple functions, you can bypass exclude by typing inf value which means infinite.
Let's see this one.
We have been encountered pre-commands and post-commands several times before this moment.
Pre-commands is for commands which will be evaluated only once before everything else.
Post-commands is for commands which will be evaluated only once after everything else.
You may remember that a few presets over here enable pre-commands or post-commands automatically for you.
Variables set in pre-commands can be captured in post-commands without doing anything extra.
Let's see this one.
These panels are standard in ToolSeq so middle-click on labels to clear panels.
There is a custom context menu button called ITEMS with both of these panels.
Insert this string list variable when you need all items in the items panel regardless they have been separated with space or new line.
Chamfer preset and Paint presets use this variable as you may find out.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
