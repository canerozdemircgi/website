Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Distance is pretty useful for precise distance calculations.
Select two vertices and left-click on the Items label to write them into the Items panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
Alright so clicking Calculate Cumulative Distances button will give simple distance result of two vertices.
You can view separated results for X, Y and Z axises as well as the final length over here.
You can also copy results from these read only boxes.
Distances are not limited by only two vertices of course.
Same distance terms are also valid for two cvs of a curve, two points of a curve, two cvs of a surface, two points of a surface and one edge.
If you select anything other than among those I counted, your selections will be converted to edges as well as selecting multiple edges.
Their seperate distances will be summed, that is why it is called cumulative.
If your items are not supported somehow, the result will be minus one.
Our next section, Select Min Edges and Select Max Edges buttons will pick results among your items written in the Items panel.
There is a precision float box which means if the difference between two lengths is below this number, they will be counted as exactly same.
So if your precision is higher more edges are tend to be choosen and if your precision is lower less edges are tend to be choosen.
The final section is about moving your items in specified axis according to minimum, maximum or center between their positions.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
