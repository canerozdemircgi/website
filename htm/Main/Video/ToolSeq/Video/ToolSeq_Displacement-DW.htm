Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Displacement is a nice tool that moves vertices based on bump maps, height maps, displacement maps so on and so forth.
That means you must have a proper map for this operation. Its type could be popular image formats like bmp, jpg, png, svg, tga, tif, so on and so forth.
Click on the button with three dots to write image file name into its own LineBox.
I prepared an example image here for this purpose.
Now select any polygonal object and click on the Shape label to write into its own LineBox.
However there is one thing you should care about. The polygonal object must have high number of vertices to fit better.
The core algorithm of displacement is implemented using OpenMaya so it will handle millions of vertices mostly in a few seconds.
There are four axises that can be moved. World axises are X, Y and Z.
There is also one more for Normal axis of vertices.
This N axis is probably what you need coz it is suitable for all objects. It can move X, Y and Z together depending on the normal vector.
Then you can select Red, Green, Blue or Alpha channels of specified image.
Those float numbers are minimum and maximum limits of moving.
A pure black pixel will be moved by limit on the left over here and a pure white pixel will be moved by limit on the right over here.
Last but not least, type the UV name in its LineBox coz matching process needs uvs, its names are generally like map1 or uvSet1.
Now let us click on the Apply button to see results.
I prepared another picture for the sake of this tutorial which has different grayscale images in different layers. Let me show you.
Now let us try a few combinations.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
