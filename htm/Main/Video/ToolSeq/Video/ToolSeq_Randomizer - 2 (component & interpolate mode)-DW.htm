Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
Let us deal with component mode.
In this mode, items panel will accept any kind of component selections like vertex, edge, face, uv, transform so on and so forth.
There are ten operations you can type. To get list of them again, left-click to the Operations label over here.
You can set multiple operations at the same time just like object mode.
movX, movY and movZ will move your components based on world axises.
movN moves your components based on normal vector of them.
The core algorithm of these four operations are implemented using OpenMaya so it will handle millions of components mostly in a few seconds.
rotX, rotY, rotZ will rotate your components and scaX, scaY, scaZ will scale your components as you can guess.
However these six operations will regard X, Y and Z axises as component space instead of world space.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
Same Set rules for object mode are also valid for component mode.
Just separate any items or internals with space instead of new line to assign exactly same random value.
Flat checkbox over here makes sure to keep same number of separated items in panel with selected items in your scene.
Otherwise Maya may shorten their multiple names into one.
Then it is gonna be passed to commands as a direct parameter which may cause undesired results.
However occasionally this may be the result you wanna achieve, if so just disable Flat option.
Let us deal with interpolate mode.
In this mode, all features related to random values are disabled coz they aren't needed.
Items panel will accept objects and internals panel will accept attributes, similar to object mode.
Attributes of first object and last object will remain same but others will be assigned by linear interpolation between them.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
Same items Set rule and internals Set rule for object mode are also valid for interpolate mode.
Flat checkbox is disabled when items panel accepts only objects coz Maya doesn't shorten object names anyway.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
