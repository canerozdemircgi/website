Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
This will be hopefully the last video of ToolSeq Randomizer and the last video of this tutorial series.
Alright so we will talk about post-processing filters. Right now there is only one filter over here, pattern.
There are seven patterns which can be used with tons of feasible permutations.
C for Cumulative, (positive C, negative C), M for Mirror, (positive M, negative M), U for Unique, S for Same and D for Default.
Alright, here is the simple rule, at first type one of these seven symbols to the pattern linebox over here.
Then type a space character, after that type an integer number which will be the parameter of previous pattern symbol.
That is it, you can repeat this cycle to create your inventive specialized pattern.
So let's begin with a simple example, (U 25 S 25 D 25).
Remember, patterns are post-process filters so they will take in place after all random values are calculated.
Our first pattern Unique will leave next twenty five results untouched.
Our second pattern Same will make next twenty five results equal by assigning first value of the block to rest twenty four values.
Let's demonstrate what I mean.
0123456789 -> 0000000000 (S 10)
9876543210 -> 9999999999 (S 10)
Default is almost similar to Same with one exception that assigns specified value in this floatbox over here instead of block's first one.
This cycle will be repeated again and again and again until it reaches end of entire random values.
Let's try this example. maya_cmds.move(0, 0, 0, _ITEMS, y=True)
This command will zero out y axis values every single time before randomization so we don't have to undo again and again.
In order to understand backend of patterns better, you may use Component Editor to see exact vertex positions for this example.
Let's try with lower parameters like (U 4 S 5 D 16).
Let's try with higher parameters like (U 40 S 10 D 120).
Since orders are important in patterns, you may consider to use custom context menu buttons in the items panel.
You can remember sort, natural, reverse and shuffle from one of our previous tutorials.
Alright so let's move on, positive Cumulative will take current value and adds into next value.
Then it will take this added value and adds into next value.
Until it reaches count of cumulative parameter set in the pattern linebox right after cumulative symbol.
One thing you should care about though, minimum and maximum limits will be certainly exceed after cumulative pattern.
Let's demonstrate what I mean.
111111 -> 123456 (+C 6)
121212 -> 134679 (+C 6)
Negative cumulative will do kinda same thing.
Except its starting point is offset by cumulative parameter. Then it goes to opposite by adding next value to previous value.
Let's demonstrate what I mean.
111111 -> 654321 (-C 6)
121212 -> 976431 (-C 6)
Let's check it out. (U 90 D 500 +C 40 -C 40)
Alright so let's move on, positive mirror will assign current value to its previous block counterpart.
Then it will apply same to next values for creating a mirror like effect.
Until it reaches count of mirror parameter set in the pattern linebox right after mirror symbol.
Let's demonstrate what I mean.
0123456789 -> 0123401234 (+M 5)
9876543210 -> 9876598765 (+M 5)
Negative mirror will do kinda same thing.
Except its counterpart starts from nearest point and goes further as loop iterator progresses.
Let's demonstrate what I mean.
0123456789 -> 0123443210 (-M 5)
9876543210 -> 9876556789 (-M 5)
Let's check it out. (+M 1 -M 1 +M 12 -M 12 +M 1 -M 1)
One last thing, you can change these seven symbols with any other letters if you desire.
Thank you in advance for watching me and using ToolSeq which is my fantastic production.
Thanks one more time for watching me until this split second, see you in other projects.
