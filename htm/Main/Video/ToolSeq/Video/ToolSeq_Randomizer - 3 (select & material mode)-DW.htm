Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
Let us deal with select mode.
In this mode, internals panel is disabled coz it is not needed.
Items panel will accept any kind of component selections like vertex, edge, face, uv, transform so on and so forth.
You may realize that initial random function is solo in this mode.
Solo is a quite simple function which returns its single parameter.
Therefore present example means only one of items will be selected.
Random value must be between one and item's count to pick properly.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
one - one thousand twenty four
Same items Set rule for object mode is also valid for select mode.
Let us deal with material mode.
In this mode, Items panel will accept components that can be material assignable like face, transform so on and so forth.
Internals panel accepts materials. You can select them in Hypershade and click on the Materials label to load quickly.
At every single iteration, one of materials written in this panel will be picked.
Randoms panel specifies how many items will be selected for materializing.
So your random value must be between one and item's count to pick properly.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
It is possible to assign materials to faces rather than transforms.
Same items Set rule for object mode is also valid for material mode.
Internals Set checkbox is disabled as you may realize which means you can't use space separator for materials in this mode.
The reason is you can't assign multiple materials to the same portion of an item.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
