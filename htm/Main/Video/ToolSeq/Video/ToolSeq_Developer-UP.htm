There has been a small change with attributes in ToolSeq Developer because it was leading another issue.
Follow these steps to work with attributes.
-	Click on the attributes radio button.
-	Type manually the name of a node which has attributes. (like pCube1, pCubeShape1, polyBevel1, lambert1)
-	Click on the enter or the return key [ big Enter key :) ] in your keyboard.
Now you will see the count of all attributes next to 'all' label and you can search any attributes you wish.
