Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq UV is a bundled tool which has almost all basic essentials of UV-Mapping.
UV-Mapping is one of the difficult processes especially for beginners. So let us start then.
Select items to be mapped and left-click on the Items label to write them into the Items panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
There is also another label which shows current uv coverage of written items on the top right side.
You can left-click over here to refresh uv coverage percentage.
There are five main options and these options are underlined as an indicator as you may realize.
If you will create uvs from stratch, you should check Unitize option.
It creates consolidated uv maps for all written items to eliminate zero map areas which cause problems at unfolding operation.
It is also useful to stick together previousy cut edges.
Afterwards you must cut right edges for preparing mesh to unfold.
You can set these edges manually by collecting in a selection set and writing your selection set name over here.
There is another utility called ToolSeq Select which you can benefit for this one.
Or you can set these edges automatically by adjusting a threshold over here.
Automatic cutting wont give you results that can be used for productions, its main purpose is testing, just keep in mind.
Unfold option is a shortcut to internal Unfold3D implemented in Maya.
Higher iterations will give slightly better results but also slightly increase run-time.
Optimize option is a shortcut to internal Optimize3D implemented in Maya.
Higher iterations will give slightly better results but also slightly increase run-time.
Layout option is a shortcut to internal Layout3D implemented in Maya.
It will pack uvs between 0-1 square.
Higher iterations will give slightly better results but also heavily increase run-time.
Higher resolution may give slightly better results but also heavily increase run-time.
Chances to give worse results in the combination of very high resolution with low iterations.
You can quickly align uv shells with Horizontal, Vertical, X axis, Y axis and Z axis options.
Or keep as is with tre sign if you aligned manually before this procedure.
You can adjust tile space and shell space parameters.
These are ratios which mean one pixel or two pixels gap will be left in two hundred fifty six pixels.
Finally you can adjust rotating parameters to fit uvs tighter.
However rotation process heavily increase run-time especially with lower steps.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
