Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Namer is a handy assistant for managing names of your objects.
It is aimed to facilitate renaming objects which have identical names.
Select your objects which may have same names and click on the Append to List button for getting a filtered list of objects which have same names.
You can see count of identical names next to its label.
You can click on any row or multiple rows of the List Widget to select and see them in your scene.
If you want to take out an object or multiple objects from the list, just click on the Extract from List button after selecting a row or multiple rows.
You can extract all objects by clicking on the Clear List button.
By default the tool ignores instanced objects coz even if you rename them, their names will be still exactly same as they tied between each other by instancing.
If you wanna see them no matter what, uncheck the Ignore Instances checkbox and click again on the Append to List button.
Then you can list them in red font color as an indicator of instancing.
Finally click on the Rename Auto in List button to quickly rename everything in the list uniquely by prefixing parent name of the object.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
