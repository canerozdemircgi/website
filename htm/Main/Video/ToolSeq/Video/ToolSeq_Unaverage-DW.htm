Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Unaverage is a mini tool that does the job as its name pointing out.
It is basically an inverse operation of the Average Vertices tool in Maya.
Select your items and left-click on the Items label to write them into the Items panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
There are three parameters here which you can change.
Amount is same as smoothing amount in the Average Vertices tool.
Its minimum limit is one and maximum limit is fifty.
Blend is the reversed blending ratio of averaging.
Its minimum limit is zero.
Value zero will have no affection, value one will have full affection.
Values more than one will have amplified affection.
The maximum limit of amount fifty comes from Average Vertices tool as I already stated so if you wanna get higher than this just increase iterations.
Increased iterations with decreased blending ratio tends to give finer results.
However increasing iterations will slow down unaverage operation.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
