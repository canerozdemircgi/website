Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Formula allows you to manipulate shapes based on equations whichever supported by the python language.
Select any polygonal object and click on the Shape label to write into its own LineBox.
The core algorithm of formula is implemented using OpenMaya so it will handle millions of vertices mostly in a few seconds.
There are two text panels as you will realize, their sizes can be changed by the splitter over here.
The top one is for commands which will be evaluated only once before everything else.
This is useful for things like importing statements or defining functions coz they don't need to run in every single iteration again.
The bottom one is for equations which will be evaluated at every single iteration, these iterations are based on vertices.
There are variables to be used in reading and writing, boths are initially x, y and z.
You must assign at least one of writeables to get a meaningful result, of course.
There are a few examples you can examine. Just select any example from the combobox and click on the Fill button to load its configuration.
Finally there are two additional checkboxes over here.
Secure option provides that if an error happens in an iteration, just bypass and continue to next iteration.
So you can skip mathematical exceptions like division by zero, negative exponent so on and so forth.
Normal variable option adds three more variables that could be used in reading. You can see them over here, xn yn and zn.
These are normal vectors of current vertex separated in world axises.
These vectors are normalized so their minimum value is zero and maximum value is one, just keep in mind.
Alright so let us click on the Formulate button to see results of a few examples pretty quickly.

-- 05 You can realize secure option is enabled here to bypass negative exponent error.
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
-- 16 You can realize normal variable option is enabled here coz xn, yn and zn variables are used in the equation.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
