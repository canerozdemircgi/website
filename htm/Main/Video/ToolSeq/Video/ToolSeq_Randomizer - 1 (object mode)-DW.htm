Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Randomizer is flagship of ToolSeq series which is specialized for doing anything that can be demonstrated with random values.
There are three panels on the top side of tool, initially.
The panel on the left one is for your items related to random mode.
Currently object mode is selected so items panel will accept objects.
Select items to be randomized and left-click on the Items label to write them into the Items panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
There are two more panels on the right, this one is called internals panel and is related to random mode.
Currently object mode is selected so internals panel will accept attributes.
Therefore that means written attributes of written items will be randomized.
Maya channel box allows attribute selections.
So you can click on the Attributes label after selecting them to write into the Internals panel as a shortcut.
For attributes in attribute editor, you can see descriptive attribute names then get exact attribute names.
There is another utility called ToolSeq Developer which you can benefit for this one.
The panel over here is for random functions which come from the python language.
You will get more detailed informations about functions in one of the future videos.
Anyway uniform function is most used random function for general purpose.
Its first parameter is minimum and second parameter is maximum limit.
Therefore present example means your random value wont be less than negative ten and wont be more than positive ten.
You can now click on the Randomize button to see results.
If you wanna assign exactly same random value to some of items, you must separate them with space in a same line.
As a shortcut you can enable Set option next to the Items label.
Then it will write or append your selections with space separator.
Same rule also applies for internals.
If you wanna assign exactly same random value to some of internals, you must separate them with space in a same line.
As a shortcut you can enable Set option next to the Internals label.
Then it will write or append your selections with space separator.
You dont have to enable set option to assign same randoms. It is just a shortcut for adding into panels with space instead of new line.
Relative checkbox near to object radiobox means, your random result will be summed or multiplied with current attribute value.
Last topic of this tutorial, the context menu of items panel is customized.
You can click on the Select Selected button after selecting some text over here to see them in your scene.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
