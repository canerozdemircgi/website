Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Freeze is an impressive tool that manipulates transformations of transforms with preserving geometry, uvs, pivots, children so on and so forth.
Select your transforms and left-click on the Transforms label to write them into the Transforms panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
There are nine transformations that can be applied as you can also see and modify them in the Channel Box when you select a transform.
TranslateX, TranslateY, TranslateZ.
RotateX, RotateY, RotateZ.
ScaleX, ScaleY, ScaleZ.
For each of them, there is a checkbox that allows you to enable or disable the modification and there is a floatbox to set the value.
Click on the Apply Transformation Matrix button to apply these transformations without actually applying it.
It could be useful when you have to freeze your transformations because an operation like Bevel for instance may need it for working properly.
Then you could get back your original transformations thanks to this tool.
There are two more features which are related with this feature.
UnFreeze Translate button restores TranslateX, TranslateY and TranslateZ attributes by matching position of object's Rotate Pivot or object's Scale Pivot.
UnFreeze Scale button restores ScaleX, ScaleY and ScaleZ attributes by matching size of object's bounding box.
If your transformations have rotate attributes, keep Consider Rotation checkbox checked to get more accurate results.
Last but not least, this tool is not compatible with instanced objects so you may get some kind of problems when working with them, just keep in mind.
