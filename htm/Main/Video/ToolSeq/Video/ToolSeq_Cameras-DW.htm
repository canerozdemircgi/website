Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Cameras is pretty straightforward.
There are four buttons which stands for different visions of cameras.
P for Perspective, left clicking or right clicking of this button will take the Perspective camera into your current viewport.
TB for Top Bottom, left click for the Top camera, right click for the Bottom camera.
FB for Front Back, left click for the Front camera, right click for the Back camera.
RL for Right Left, left click for the Right camera and right click for the Left camera.
There is also one more feature that middle clicking any of these buttons will toggle the Ortographic property of current angle of current camera of current viewport.
You can see and modify these cameras in the Outliner.
If your scene already have cameras which have same names, it will automatically recognize and use them.
So if you want to reset any of the camera just delete it and then reopen this tool to recreate it.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
