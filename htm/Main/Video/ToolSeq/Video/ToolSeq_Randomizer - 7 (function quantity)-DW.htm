Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
We have been encountered function quantity several times before this moment.
If you gonna use only one function, set this combobox over here to Single for calling exact same function at every single iteration.
It is the initial option anyway.
If you gonna use multiple functions sequentially, set it to Sequential One Next Two or Sequential Two Next One.
There are two sequential options coz there are two kind of process orders in Randomizer workflow.
Object mode, Command mode and Color mode start to loop items then inner loop internals.
But in contrast Component mode starts to loop internals then inner loops items.
Therefore to match internals with randoms one by one, you have to use Sequential One Next Two for object, command and color modes.
To match items with randoms one by one, you have to use Sequential Two Next One for object, command and color modes.
But in contrast to match internals with randoms one by one, you have to use Sequential Two Next One for component mode.
To match items with randoms one by one, you have to use Sequential One Next Two for component mode.
It is not that hard after all.
Alright, interpolate mode has nothing to do with randoms anyway.
Select, Material and Replace modes can't benefit sequential option because their core must use standard methods to work properly.
These modes call from randoms panel only once to get how many items will be selected.
Alright you may remember that these six presets over here switch to sequential option automatically for you.
Furthermore Color mode switches to sequential automatically if you select rgb, hsv or hsl models.
Alright so let's test it pretty quickly.
Since orders are important in sequential options, you may consider to use custom context menu buttons in the items panel.
Sort as its name pointing out, will sort alphanumerically and natural will also sort but in more human friendly way.
Reverse and shuffle, as their names pointing out, will reverse and will shuffle items list.
Let's see those really quick.
Alright the last option of Percentage in the function quantity combobox, ensures to generate biased randoms.
Biased random allows to adjust value distributions manually by picking a random function in each call.
These random functions have additional ratios which are roughly their chances to be picked.
To achieve this, write multiple functions of any kind and separate them with new lines just like sequential functions.
Then append a big straight vertical bar then append the probability factor at the end of each line.
Higher factor means higher probability of the function in each call.
Alright so let's see percentage in action with movY component mode operation.
You will realize most values are literally just zero coz this function over here has higher probability so has been picked quite more.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
