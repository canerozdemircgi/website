Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Pivot gives users extensive support for handling pivots.
Select your transforms and left-click on the Transforms label to write them into the Transforms panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
There are three checkboxes which limits all operations. X Y and Z.
These would allow or deny all operations to affect on chosen world axises.
The first section of Minimum, Maximum or Center buttons moves Rotate Pivots as well as Scale Pivots by using bounding box of transforms.
Create Locators from Transforms Pivot button of the next section, as the name points out, creates locator to Rotate Pivot position or Scale Pivot position of transforms.
The final section needs a locator for its procedures.
Select a locator and click on the Locator label to write into its own LineBox.
Then you can move Rotate Pivot as well as Scale Pivot of your transforms to position of the locator by clicking Move Transforms Pivot to Locator button.
In the end you can move your transforms by matching its Rotate Pivot position or Scale Pivot position to locator's position when you click on the Match Transforms Pivot to Locator button.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
