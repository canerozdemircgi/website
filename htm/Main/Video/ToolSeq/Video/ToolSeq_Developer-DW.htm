Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Developer is for the people who uses mel or python commands of Maya.
There are four sections you can choose.
Mel section gets all commands and procedures defined in the mel language.
You can see count of all available values right here next to the All label.
You can search commands by typing anything in the LineBox here and clicking to the Search button or pressing Enter key in your keyboard.
You can see count of your search results right here next to the Filtered label.
If you search an empty word, it will list all things as you can see all and filtered counts are same now.
You can also limit results by Case Sensitive searching.
You can select any of results by highlighting and click on the Help button to see generic informations about specified command in the Script Editor.
Our next Python section gets all maya.cmds commands defined in the python language.
Same search and help terms are also valid here. Just search and get info about anything you wish.
Now next Global variables section gets all global variables defined in the mel language.
Same search terms are also valid here.
You can select any of results by highlighting and click on the Preview button to see values of specified variable in the Script Editor.
There is also one more section called Attributes.
When you click on it, your selected item will be written in the LineBox here so that means you have to select something.
And if you didnt select anything, just select one of items which has attributes in your scene and click it again.
So now you can see count of all attributes over here.
Same search and preview terms are also valid here.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
