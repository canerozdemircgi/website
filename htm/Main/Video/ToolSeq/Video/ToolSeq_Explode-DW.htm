Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so ToolSeq Explode is a simple one which can be used before baking maps.
Your low poly and high poly transforms must be grouped separately but their children must be sorted exactly same.
It matches only one level direct children of groups so it allows to have different total transform counts between them.
I prepared an example of low poly and high poly groups over here so let us check it out.
Select your low groups and left-click on the Low-Groups label to write them into the Low-Groups panel.
Select your high groups and left-click on the High-Groups label to write them into the High-Groups panel.
By the way these panels are standard in ToolSeq so you can right-click on labels for appending selections into panels.
Or middle-click on labels to clear panels.
Additionally you can see count of panels next to their labels.
These float numbers are minimum and maximum limits of randoms which will be used at moving for the specified axis.
Making them higher range reduces the probability of collision but also could make managing a little bit more difficult.
Now let us click on the Apply button to explode low poly and high poly objects together.
After clicking the Apply button, you can make manual modifications if you wish so.
Then you can bake your maps or do whatever you wish and after that click on the Revert button to restore original positions of shapes.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
