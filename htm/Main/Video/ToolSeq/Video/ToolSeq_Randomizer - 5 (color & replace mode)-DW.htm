Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
Let us deal with color mode.
In this mode, Items panel will accept materials and components that can be material assignable like face, transform so on and so forth.
Internals panel accepts vector attributes which have three elements like color, outColor, ambientColor, incandescence so on and so forth. (inkendessÄ±ns)
Color Method combobox over here has three options. Direct, Find and Assign.
If you gonna add materials to the items panel, use direct mode.
If you gonna add objects or faces to the items panel, you may use Find to find their materials then process upon them.
Or you may use Assign to assign brand new materials then process upon them.
If you select assign, this editable combobox over here is activated to type which kind of material you would like to create.
There are four color models you can choose; grayscale, red-green-blue, hue-saturation-value, hue-saturation-lightness.
The latter three have three random functions which represent channels of rgb, hsv, hsl separately.
You will get more detailed informations about sequential functions in one of the future videos.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
You can also take faces to assign new materials as I already stated.
Same items Set rule and internals Set rule for object mode are also valid for color mode.
Let us deal with replace mode.
In this mode, both of Items panel and Internals panel will accept objects.
At every single iteration, one of objects written in the internals panel will be picked.
Randoms panel specifies how many items in the items panel will be selected to be replaced.
So your random value must be between one and item's count to pick properly.
You can achieve your replacements by copying or instancing the source item.
This copied or instanced object will be moved to position of the destination item by matching their either rotate pivots or scale pivots.
Then you can transfer rotate and scale attributes if you wish so.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
Same items Set rule for object mode is also valid for replace mode.
Internals Set checkbox is disabled coz you cant replace one object to multiple objects with keeping same names.
You can make a single group from multiple objects and use that one anyway.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
