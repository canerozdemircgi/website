Welcome to the ToolSeq tutorials of Autodesk Maya.
Alright so we will continue to ToolSeq Randomizer.
Let us deal with command mode.
In this mode, items panel will accept any kind of component selections like vertex, edge, face, uv, transform so on and so forth.
Internals panel accepts python commands. You can left-click on the Commands label to get last executed mel command quickly.
You have to convert it to python equivalent though. To do this you should use maya_cmds namespace.
There is a custom context menu button for command mode only in internals panel that you can benefit to quickly append this namespace.
There are two more buttons over here, ITEM is a string list variable holding names of items in current iteration.
RANDOM.Get is a method returns a random float value calculated internally based on your configuration in current iteration.
You probably have to use both of item string and random float in a maya command to get a proper result.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
Same items Set rule for object mode is also valid for command mode.
Therefore don't forget that ITEM variable can keep multiple names as a list which is separated with spaces in an iteration.
Click on the Randomize button to see results.
There is no internal set because internals are custom commands in this mode.
Besides you can write its own code that will assign same value to different parameters.
There is a preset tab over here which contains several configurations in command mode.
These presets are based on default preset so you have to switch default before switching any other preset properly.
Let's test them one by one pretty quickly.
Bevel is for transforms and is not applicable for component levels like faces, edges, etc if they are not appended as a whole set.
Because it changes component ids so next iteration becomes non-deterministic.
Alright so let's try bevel.
Chamfer is applicable for vertices as you can confirm in Edit Mesh menu.
You will realize that there is a post-commands panel over here.
You will get more detailed informations about post-commands in one of the future videos.
Alright so let's try chamfer.
Extrude Vertex, Extrude Edge and Extrude Face buttons, as their name points out, are applicable for vertices, edges and faces.
Alright so let's try extrude.
Paint Gray, RGB, HSV, HSL buttons are applicable for vertices, faces, vertex faces and transforms.
They are vertex painting commands which have grayscale, red-green-blue, hue-saturation-value, hue-saturation-lightness color models.
The latter three have three random functions which represent channels of rgb, hsv, or hsl separately.
You will get more detailed informations about sequential functions in one of the future videos.
Values are interpolated from zero to one. For example in red channel, zero means zero, one hundred twenty eight means zero dot five and two hundred fifty five means one.
You will realize that there is a pre-commands panel over here.
You will get more detailed informations about pre-commands in one of the future videos.
Alright so let's try paint.
Wire presets are similar to paint, applicable to objects and will override wireframe color attribute of objects.
Alright so let's try wire.
Same items Set rule for command mode is also valid for presets.
Remember to switch default when you are done to reset randomizer configuration.
Thanks for watching me, see you in the next video.
