Course Schedule
There are a total of <u>numCourses</u> courses you have to take, labeled from <u>0</u> to <u>numCourses - 1</u>. You are given an array <u>prerequisites</u> where <u>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</u> indicates that you <b>must</b> take course <u>b<sub>i</sub></u> first if you want to take course <u>a<sub>i</sub></u>.

<ul>
<li>For example, the pair <u>[0, 1]</u>, indicates that to take course <u>0</u> you have to first take course <u>1</u>.</li>
</ul>

Return <u>true</u> if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return <u>false</u>.

Example 1
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Hint 1
This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
