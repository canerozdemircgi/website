Hint 1
Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do.

Hint 2
We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column and then we move inwards by 1 and then repeat. That's all, that is all the simulation that we need.

Hint 3
Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on
i
out of
[i, j]
, you'd be shifting in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for
j
, you'd be shifting in the same row. Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to run the simulation on edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.
