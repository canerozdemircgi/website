Components in a Graph
There are <b>2 x N</b> nodes in an undirected graph and a number of edges connecting some nodes. In each edge, the first value will be between <b>1</b> and <b>N</b>, inclusive. The second node will be between <b>N + 1</b> and <b>2 x N</b>, inclusive.

Given a list of edges, determine the size of the <u>smallest</u> and <u>largest</u> connected components that have <b>2 or more</b> nodes. A node can have any number of connections. The highest node value will always be connected to <b>at least 1</b> other node.

<b>Note</b> that single nodes should not be considered in the answer.

bg = [[1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4]]
Since the component with node 3 contains only one node, it is not considered.
The number of vertices in the smallest connected component in the graph is 2 based on (2, 4).
The number of vertices in the largest connected component in the graph is 3 i.e. 1 - 5 - 6.
The smaller component contains 2 nodes and the larger contains 3.
Return the array [2, 3].

Since the component with node 5 contains only one node, it is not considered.
The number of vertices in the smallest connected component in the graph is 2 based on either (3, 8) or (4, 9).
The number of vertices in the largest connected component in the graph is 4 i.e. 1 - 2 - 6 - 7.
The smaller component contains 2 nodes and the larger contains 4.
Return the array [2, 4].
