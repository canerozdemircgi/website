Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

<b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li>Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.</li>
<li>In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in <b>Example 3</b>, the input represents the signed integer. <u>-3</u>.</li>
</ul>
