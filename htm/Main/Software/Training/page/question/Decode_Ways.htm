Decode Ways
A message containing letters from <u>A-Z</u> can be <b>encoded</b> into numbers using the following mapping

<u>'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"</u>

To <b>decode</b> an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, <u>"11106"</u> can be mapped into

<ul>
<li><u>"AAJF"</u> with the grouping <u>(1 1 10 6)</u></li>
<li><u>"KJF"</u> with the grouping <u>(11 10 6)</u></li>
</ul>

Note that the grouping <u>(1 11 06)</u> is invalid because <u>"06"</u> cannot be mapped into <u>'F'</u> since <u>"6"</u> is different from <u>"06"</u>.

Given a string <u>s</u> containing only digits, return the <b>number</b> of ways to <b>decode</b> it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a <b>32-bit</b> integer.

Constraints
<ul>
<li>1 <= s.length <= 100</li>
<li>s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).</li>
</ul>
</fieldset-description>

<div class='br60'></div>

<fieldset-description class='f_mono'>
Example 1
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

<div class='br20'></div>

<fieldset-description class='f_mono'>
Example 2
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
</fieldset-description>

<div class='br20'></div>

<fieldset-description class='f_mono'>
Example 3
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.

<fieldset-description class='f_mono'>
Example 4
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
