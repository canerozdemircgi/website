Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings <u>text1</u> and <u>text2</u>, return the length of their longest <b>common subsequence</b>. If there is no <b>common subsequence</b>, return <u>0</u>.

A <b>subsequence</b> of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

<ul>
<li>For example, <u>"ace"</u> is a subsequence of <u>"abcde"</u>.</li>
</ul>

A <b>common subsequence</b> of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Constraints
<ul>
<li>1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000</li>
<li>text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.</li>
</ul>

Example 1
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

<fieldset-description class='f_mono'>
Example 3
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Hint 1
Try dynamic programming. DP[i][j] represents the longest common subsequence of text1[0 ... i] & text2[0 ... j].

<fieldset-description class='f_sans'>
Hint 2
DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, if text1[i] == text2[j] DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]), otherwise
