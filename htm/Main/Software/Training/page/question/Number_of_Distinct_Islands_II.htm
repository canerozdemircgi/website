Number of Distinct Islands II
Given a non-empty 2D array <u>grid</u> of <u>0</u>'s and <u>1</u>'s, an <b>island</b> is a group of <u>1</u>'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of <b>distinct</b> islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape or have the same shape after <b>rotation</b> (90, 180 or 270 degrees only) or <b>reflection</b> (left/right direction or up/down direction).

Example 1
Input: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The island looks like this:
11000
10000
00001
00011

Notice that:
11
10
and
01
11
are considered same island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.

Example 2
Input: [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The island looks like this:
11100
10001
01001
01110

Here are the two distinct islands:
111
1
and
1
1

Notice that:
111
1
and
1
111
are considered same island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.
