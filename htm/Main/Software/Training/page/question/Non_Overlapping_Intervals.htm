Example 1
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1, 3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1, 2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
